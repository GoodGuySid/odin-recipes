        <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
            <p>This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've tried, but for super tender ribs, give it a try! Lean, country-style pork ribs are boiled in seasoned water until tender, then finished up in the oven under a blanket of your favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>2 1/2 pounds country-style pork ribs</li>

                <li>1 cup barbeque sauce</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Place ribs in a large pot and cover with water. Stir in kosher salt, garlic powder, and pepper, and bring water to a boil over medium heat. Continue to boil until ribs are tender, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
