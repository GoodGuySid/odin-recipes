        <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
        <p>This beef stroganoff is made with beef chuck roast, beef broth, white wine, mushrooms, and sour cream. It is the best I've ever had and well worth the effort.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>4 ounces butter</li>
                <li>4 green onions, sliced (white parts only)</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 can condensed beef broth</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon prepared mustard</li>
                <li>1 can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
                <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1/3 cup white wine</li>
                <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove any fat and gristle from chuck roast; cut into strips 1/2 inch thick by 2-inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef and brown quickly.</li>
                <li>Push beef to one side of the skillet. Add onions; cook and stir for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with beef.</li>
                <li>Stir flour into juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the beef is tender.</li>
                <li>Five minutes before serving, stir in mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Cook until heated through; season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Enjoy served over hot cooked noodles.</li>
